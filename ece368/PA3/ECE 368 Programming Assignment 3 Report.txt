ECE 368 Programming Assignment 3 Report
Time complexity:
	Tree Constructing:
	Function involved: load_tree
		This function construct the tree with stacks and build the tree 
		immediately after getting the informations. The tree is built 
		after one pass of all data. The time complexity is T(n) = n = O(n).
	
	Coordinate Calculation:
	Function involved: calc_y, save_tree_and_calc_x
		calc_y calculate the y coordinate only with one inorder traversal 
		starting from the right branch. The time complexity for calc_y is T(n) = n = O(n).

		save_tree_and_calc_x calculate the x coordinates only with one 
		inorder traversal starting from the left branch, and write the 
		data into the file immediately after that. The function also 
		require only one pass. The time complexity for save_tree_and_calc_x 
		is also T(n) = n = O(n).
