ECE 368 Programming Assignment 5 Report
Method: 
	This algorithm represent the problem as a graph with adjacency matrix. 
	After the contruction of the matrix, all nodes that are common and 
	connected are denoted 1 while everything else remains 0. If an entire row is 0,
	then the first element is denoted -1;
	Based on the matrix builded, the program run recursively and store the current
	sequence in a temporary array. If it is longer than an existing sequence, the 
	sequence is updated.

Time complexity:
	Let the number of sequences be m.
	Let the number of numbers in the input sequence be n.
	load_from_file:
		It takes n x m to set the connection in the matrix which is O(n^2);
		It takes an extra n^2 time to find the row with most connections.
	find_seq:
		Starting from the row with most connections, run recursivly to find the
		longest common sequence of the input file.
		The time complexity is O(n^2)
