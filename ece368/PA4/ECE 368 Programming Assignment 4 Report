ECE 368 Programming Assignment 4 Report
Time complexity
	The reroot algorithm visit every node of the tree for only one time, 
	Thus the time complexity is O(n).

Space complexity
	The reroot algorithm was structured as recursion. The number of stack
	 frames would generally be log(n) for a tree with n nodes. Thus the 
	space complexity of the algorithm is O(logn). Other than that, the 
	reroot algorithm doesn't require any other extra space except two 
	more fields(alt_w, alt_h) is added to the Tnode struct.
