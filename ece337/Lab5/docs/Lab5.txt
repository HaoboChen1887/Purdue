What is the minimum amount of time that data_ready must remain asserted to ensure correct operation? What is the minimum amount of time, in clock cycles, that data must remain valid after data_ready is asserted in order to ensure correct operation?
2 cycles. Because both IDLE and STORE state require the assertion of dr to proceed correcly or it will go to error state.

How are the image files different? Does this make sense given the filter design built in the lab? Why or why not?
The filtered file only shows the major edges in the original file. This makes sense because the coeffcients passed in to the filter made it a high pass filter.

What is the general syntax for each of the file IO functions used in the provided test bench?
$fopen(filename, permission_ in_ string)
$fscanf(file_descriptor, string_format, output_variable)
$fseek(file_descriptor, offset, pointer_location)
$fclose(file_descriptor)

What are the different format specifiers available for use in file functions like $fscanf()?
%d %D %i %o %u %x %f %s %c %[ %p %n
